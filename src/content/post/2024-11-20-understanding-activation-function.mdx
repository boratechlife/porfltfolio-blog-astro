## What are Activation Functions in TensorFlow?

Activation functions are mathematical operations applied to neurons in a neural network to introduce non-linearity. They determine whether a neuron should be activated (i.e., contribute to the output of the network) based on its input.

Without activation functions, neural networks would only be able to solve linear problems, limiting their usefulness in complex real-world tasks.

### Why Are Activation Functions Important?

1. **Enable Non-Linear Learning**:
   - Activation functions allow neural networks to approximate complex, non-linear mappings from input to output.
   - For example, tasks like image recognition, natural language processing, and time-series prediction all require non-linear decision boundaries.

2. **Determine the Output Range**:
   - Activation functions define the range of outputs for each neuron, impacting the stability and performance of the network during training.

3. **Introduce Differentiability**:
   - Most activation functions are differentiable, which is essential for optimizing neural networks using gradient-based methods like backpropagation.

### Common Activation Functions in TensorFlow

TensorFlow provides several activation functions, each suited to specific tasks:

#### **1. ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)**
- **Purpose**: Introduces sparsity and is computationally efficient.
- **Use Case**: Commonly used in hidden layers of deep networks.

```ts title="ReLU in TensorFlow.js"
import * as tf from '@tensorflow/tfjs';
const reluOutput = tf.layers.dense({ units: 128, activation: 'relu' });
```


2. Sigmoid
Purpose: Outputs probabilities in the range [0, 1].
Use Case: Often used in binary classification problems.

```js
const sigmoidOutput = tf.layers.dense({ units: 1, activation: 'sigmoid' });


```

3. Tanh (Hyperbolic Tangent)

Purpose: Outputs values in the range [-1, 1].
Use Case: Useful in tasks requiring outputs centered around 0.

```js
const tanhOutput = tf.layers.dense({ units: 64, activation: 'tanh' });

```

4. Softmax
Purpose: Converts logits into probabilities that sum to 1.
Use Case: Used in the output layer for multi-class classification.

```js
const softmaxOutput = tf.layers.dense({ units: 10, activation: 'softmax' });

```

## How to Choose the Right Activation Function?

1. **Hidden Layers**:
   - Use `ReLU` or its variants (e.g., Leaky ReLU, Parametric ReLU) for most tasks.
   - `Tanh` can be used when outputs need to be zero-centered.

2. **Output Layers**:
   - For **binary classification**, use `Sigmoid`.
   - For **multi-class classification**, use `Softmax`.

3. **Complex Networks**:
   - Experiment with advanced functions like Swish or GELU to improve performance in deep networks.
