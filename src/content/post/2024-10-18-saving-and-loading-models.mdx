## How to Save and Restore Models in TensorFlow.js

In machine learning, saving and restoring models is super important. You don’t want to train your model from scratch every time you run your program. Instead, you can **save** the model after training and **restore** it later when you want to use it again. TensorFlow.js makes this process simple.

In this tutorial, you’ll learn how to:
1. **Save a model** after training.
2. **Restore (load) a model** so you can use it later without retraining.

Let’s get started!

### Saving a Model in TensorFlow.js

After you’ve trained your model, you can easily save it to your local machine or a remote server.

Here’s how to save your model:

```js title="Saving a Model in TensorFlow.js"
import * as tf from '@tensorflow/tfjs';

// Create a simple model
const model = tf.sequential();
model.add(tf.layers.dense({units: 10, inputShape: [5]}));
model.add(tf.layers.dense({units: 1}));

// Compile the model
model.compile({
  optimizer: 'sgd',
  loss: 'meanSquaredError',
});

// Save the model to the browser's local storage
async function saveModel() {
  await model.save('localstorage://my-model');
  console.log('Model saved to local storage!');
}

// Call the function to save the model
saveModel();
```

### What Does This Code Do?

- Define the Model: We create a simple neural network model with two layers.
- Compile the Model: We define how the model will train (using an optimizer and a loss function).
- Save the Model: We use the model.save() method to save the model. In this case, it’s saved to the browser's local storage, but you can also save it to a file or a remote server.

### Restoring (Loading) a Saved Model
Once you’ve saved a model, you can load it back and use it for making predictions, retraining, or further fine-tuning.
Here’s how to restore a model:

```js
import * as tf from '@tensorflow/tfjs';

// Load the model from local storage
async function loadModel() {
  const restoredModel = await tf.loadLayersModel('localstorage://my-model');
  console.log('Model restored from local storage!');

  // Use the model to make predictions or continue training
  restoredModel.summary();
}

// Call the function to load the model
loadModel();

```

### Other Save Options
You can save models to different locations:

- Local storage: localstorage://my-model
- IndexedDB: indexeddb://my-model
- Download as file: downloads://my-model
- Remote server: Provide a server URL to save the model remotely.

Example of saving the model as a downloadable file:

```js

async function saveModelAsFile() {
  await model.save('downloads://my-model');
  console.log('Model saved as a file!');
}
saveModelAsFile();

```
