## How to Perform Element-Wise Multiplication of Tensors in TensorFlow.js

In TensorFlow.js, **element-wise multiplication** allows you to multiply two tensors by multiplying each corresponding element from the two tensors. This is a common operation in many machine learning tasks, where you need to apply transformations to data or weights in a neural network.

In this guide, we’ll show you how to perform element-wise multiplication of two tensors using a simple example.

### What Is Element-Wise Multiplication?

Element-wise multiplication means multiplying each element in one tensor with the corresponding element in another tensor. For this operation to work, both tensors must have the same shape.

For example:
- If you have tensor `[a, b, c]` and tensor `[x, y, z]`, element-wise multiplication would result in `[a*x, b*y, c*z]`.

### Example of Element-Wise Multiplication

Let’s create two tensors and multiply them element by element.

```js title="Element-Wise Multiplication of Tensors"
import * as tf from '@tensorflow/tfjs';

// Create two tensors
const tensorA = tf.tensor([1, 2, 3]);
const tensorB = tf.tensor([4, 5, 6]);

// Perform element-wise multiplication
const result = tensorA.mul(tensorB);
console.log(result.toString());
```

```js
Tensor
   [4, 10, 18]

```

In this example:

- Tensor tensorA contains [1, 2, 3].
- Tensor tensorB contains [4, 5, 6].
By performing element-wise multiplication, the result is [1*4, 2*5, 3*6], which equals [4, 10, 18].

### Why Is Element-Wise Multiplication Useful?
- Data Transformation: Element-wise multiplication is often used to apply transformations to each data point individually.
- Neural Networks: In machine learning, you can use element-wise multiplication to update weights or apply specific operations to each element of a tensor in neural networks.
- Efficiency: TensorFlow.js handles element-wise multiplication efficiently, even for large datasets, allowing you to process data quickly.
