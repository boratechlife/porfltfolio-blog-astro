## How to Create a Tensor in TensorFlow.js

A **tensor** is the core building block in TensorFlow.js and is used to represent data in different dimensions. Whether you are working with single numbers, lists of numbers, or complex multi-dimensional data (like images), tensors are the main way to store and manipulate that data.

In this tutorial, we'll show you how to create a tensor in TensorFlow.js using easy-to-understand examples. Let’s start with the basics!

### Creating a Simple Tensor

You can create a tensor in TensorFlow.js by using the `tf.tensor` function. This function allows you to pass in data (like a list of numbers), and it will transform it into a tensor.

Here’s an example of how to create a **1D tensor** (a vector of numbers):

```js title="Creating a 1D Tensor in TensorFlow.js"
import * as tf from '@tensorflow/tfjs';

// Create a 1D tensor (vector)
const tensor1D = tf.tensor([1, 2, 3, 4]);
console.log(tensor1D.toString());
```

```js
Tensor
   [1, 2, 3, 4]

```
This creates a tensor with 4 numbers, similar to a list or array, but with TensorFlow’s powerful data handling capabilities.

### Creating a 2D Tensor (Matrix)
You can also create a 2D tensor, which is like a table or matrix. This is useful when working with images, tables of data, or any grid-like data structure.

Here’s how you can create a simple 2D tensor:
```ts
const tensor2D = tf.tensor([[1, 2], [3, 4]]);
console.log(tensor2D.toString());

```

```ts
Tensor
   [[1, 2],
    [3, 4]]

```
This creates a 2x2 matrix, which is a basic example of a 2D tensor.

### Higher-Dimensional Tensors
Tensors in TensorFlow.js can have more than two dimensions. For example, a 3D tensor might represent an image with multiple color channels (like red, green, and blue). You can create higher-dimensional tensors the same way by passing more nested arrays.

Here’s an example of a 3D tensor:

```js
const tensor3D = tf.tensor([[[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[5, 6], [7, 8]]]);
console.log(tensor3D.toString());

```

```js

Tensor
   [[[1, 2], [3, 4]],
    [[5, 6], [7, 8]]]

```
This creates a 3D tensor with shape [2, 2, 2], which could represent two color images, each with 2x2 pixels.
