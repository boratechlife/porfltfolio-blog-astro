## Transfer Learning with Pre-Trained Models in TensorFlow.js

Transfer learning is a powerful technique where a model trained on a large dataset is adapted for a specific task with a smaller dataset. TensorFlow.js provides access to pre-trained models that can be fine-tuned or used as feature extractors for custom datasets.

In this tutorial, we explore how to apply transfer learning to a tabular dataset.

### Why Use Transfer Learning for Tabular Data?

While pre-trained models are typically designed for image or text data, the idea can be adapted to tabular data. The pre-trained model's layers can be repurposed to extract generalized patterns that can enhance your dataset's predictive accuracy.

---

### Step 1: Choose a Pre-Trained Model

TensorFlow.js offers several pre-trained models (e.g., MobileNet, ResNet, etc.), which are primarily for image data. For tabular data, we simulate transfer learning by using the feature extraction capabilities of a dense neural network.

---

### Step 2: Load the Pre-Trained Model

Weâ€™ll use a dense neural network pretrained on similar tabular data and freeze its layers to extract features.

```javascript title="Loading a Pre-Trained Model"
import * as tf from '@tensorflow/tfjs';

// Load a pre-trained model (here, we simulate one using a sequential model)
const baseModel = tf.sequential();

// Simulate pre-trained layers
baseModel.add(tf.layers.dense({ units: 64, inputShape: [3], activation: 'relu' }));
baseModel.add(tf.layers.dense({ units: 32, activation: 'relu' }));

// Freeze the pre-trained layers
baseModel.layers.forEach(layer => layer.trainable = false);

// View the base model's summary
baseModel.summary();
```
### Step 3: Add Custom Layers for Tabular Data
Add new layers on top of the pre-trained model to customize it for the specific tabular dataset.

```js
const model = tf.sequential();

// Add the pre-trained layers
model.add(baseModel);

// Add new layers for the custom task
model.add(tf.layers.dense({ units: 16, activation: 'relu' }));
model.add(tf.layers.dense({ units: 1, activation: 'sigmoid' })); // Binary classification

// Compile the model
model.compile({
  optimizer: tf.train.adam(),
  loss: 'binaryCrossentropy',
  metrics: ['accuracy'],
});

// View the complete model's summary
model.summary();

```
### Step 4: Preprocess the Dataset
Preprocess the tabular dataset to align with the input requirements of the model.

```js
const rawData = [
  { high: 2363.35, low: 2361.75, entryPrice: 2363.43, outcomeBinary: 'win' },
  { high: 2363.93, low: 2362.08, entryPrice: 2363.99, outcomeBinary: 'lose' },
  // More rows...
];

// Convert data to numerical format
const preprocessData = (data) => data.map(row => ({
  high: row.high,
  low: row.low,
  entryPrice: row.entryPrice,
  outcome: row.outcomeBinary === 'win' ? 1 : 0,
}));

const processedData = preprocessData(rawData);

// Extract features and labels
const features = processedData.map(row => [row.high, row.low, row.entryPrice]);
const labels = processedData.map(row => row.outcome);

// Convert to tensors
const xs = tf.tensor2d(features);
const ys = tf.tensor1d(labels, 'int32');


```

## Step 5: Train the Model
Train the full model with frozen pre-trained layers and custom layers.

```js
(async () => {
  await model.fit(xs, ys, {
    epochs: 30,
    batchSize: 16,
    validationSplit: 0.2, // Reserve 20% of data for validation
    callbacks: {
      onEpochEnd: (epoch, logs) => {
        console.log(`Epoch ${epoch + 1}: Loss = ${logs.loss}, Accuracy = ${logs.acc}`);
      },
    },
  });
})();

```

### Step 6: Evaluate the Model
Evaluate the model to measure its performance on unseen data

```js
const evaluation = model.evaluate(xs, ys);
evaluation[0].print(); // Loss
evaluation[1].print(); // Accuracy

```

### Best Practices for Transfer Learning
- **Freeze Pre-Trained Layers:** Ensure pre-trained layers are not updated during training to retain their learned features.

- **Feature Scaling:** Normalize the tabular data to improve compatibility with pre-trained layers.

- **Gradual Unfreezing:** Fine-tune pre-trained layers by gradually unfreezing them during training.

- **Use Pre-Trained Embeddings:** Experiment with embeddings from similar datasets for better generalization.



### Where do we get tensorflow pre-trained models?

#### 1. TensorFlow Hub
TensorFlow Hub is the official repository for pre-trained models that can be used across a variety of tasks.

**URL:** https://tfhub.dev/
**Features:**
- Models for image classification, text embeddings, object detection, etc.
- Easy integration with TensorFlow and TensorFlow.js.
- Browse models with descriptions and examples.
**Example: Loading a Pre-Trained Model from TensorFlow Hub**

```js
import * as tf from '@tensorflow/tfjs';
import * as tfHub from '@tensorflow/tfjs-hub';

// Load a pre-trained MobileNet model from TensorFlow Hub
const model = await tfHub.load('https://tfhub.dev/google/tfjs-model/imagenet/mobilenet_v2_100_224/classification/3');
model.summary();
```
