## What is the Difference Between a Constant Tensor and a Variable Tensor in TensorFlow.js?

In TensorFlow.js, you can store data as **tensors**, but not all tensors are the same. Two common types are **constant tensors** and **variable tensors**. While they may seem similar, they behave differently and are used in different situations. Let's break it down!

### Constant Tensor

A **constant tensor** is a tensor whose values never change after being created. Think of it like a fixed number or a piece of data that you don't want to modify. Once you set the values, you can't update or change them. 

For example:

```js title="Creating a Constant Tensor"
import * as tf from '@tensorflow/tfjs';

// Create a constant tensor
const constTensor = tf.tensor([1, 2, 3, 4]);
console.log(constTensor.toString());
```

In this case, constTensor is a constant tensor and its values [1, 2, 3, 4] will remain the same throughout the program. This is useful when you have data that doesn’t need to be changed, like a fixed input for a machine learning model.
### Variable Tensor

A variable tensor, on the other hand, is a tensor that can be updated or modified. This makes it useful when you need to change the values during the program, like when training a machine learning model where the model’s weights get updated after each iteration.

You can create a variable tensor using the tf.variable() function:

```js caption="variable tensor"
const varTensor = tf.variable(tf.tensor([1, 2, 3, 4]));
console.log(varTensor.toString());

// Now let's update the variable tensor
varTensor.assign(tf.tensor([5, 6, 7, 8]));
console.log(varTensor.toString());

```

Here, varTensor starts with the values [1, 2, 3, 4], but after using the assign function, the values are updated to [5, 6, 7, 8]. This is great when you want to change the data as the program runs.

### Why is This Important?
- Constant tensors are great for storing things like configuration settings, static inputs, or data that doesn't need to change.
- Variable tensors are essential for machine learning models, where you need to update the model's weights as it learns from the data.
