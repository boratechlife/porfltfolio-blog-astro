## How are Tensors Represented in TensorFlow?

In TensorFlow, tensors are used to encapsulate data for easy manipulation and computation. Every tensor is characterized by three main attributes: rank, shape, and data type.

### Rank of a Tensor

The **rank** of a tensor is the number of dimensions it possesses, which corresponds to the levels of nested arrays. The rank provides a way to categorize tensors:

- Rank 0: Scalar (single number)
- Rank 1: Vector (array of numbers)
- Rank 2: Matrix (two-dimensional array)
- Rank 3 or higher: Tensors with 3 or more dimensions

### Shape of a Tensor

The **shape** of a tensor refers to the tuple of integers that describes the tensor's dimensionality. Each number in the shape represents the size of the tensor along a specific axis. For example, a matrix with 2 rows and 3 columns has a shape of (2, 3).

### Data Type of a Tensor

Tensors in TensorFlow are created with a specific **data type**, such as `tf.int32`, `tf.float64`, or `tf.string`. This attribute defines the type of data elements that the tensor can store.

### Practical Example

Here is an example demonstrating how to create a tensor in TensorFlow and identify its rank, shape, and data type:

```ts title="Creating and Examining a Tensor"
import * as tf from '@tensorflow/tfjs';

// Create a 2D tensor (matrix)
const tensor = tf.tensor([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], [2, 3], 'int32');
console.log(`Rank: ${tensor.rank}`);
console.log(`Shape: ${tensor.shape}`);
console.log(`Data Type: ${tensor.dtype}`);
```
