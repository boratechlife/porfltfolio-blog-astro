## Building a Linear Regression Model with TensorFlow.js

Linear regression is a fundamental concept in machine learning used to predict a target variable based on a linear relationship with one or more features. TensorFlow.js enables you to implement this directly in JavaScript, allowing for powerful in-browser computations.

### Key Steps to Implement Linear Regression

1. **Define the Model Architecture**
2. **Compile the Model**
3. **Train the Model**
4. **Make Predictions**

### Example: A Simple Linear Regression Model

Below is a step-by-step guide to creating a basic linear regression model using TensorFlow.js.

```ts title="Linear Regression in TensorFlow.js"
import * as tf from '@tensorflow/tfjs';

// Step 1: Define the model architecture
const model = tf.sequential();
model.add(tf.layers.dense({ units: 1, inputShape: [1] })); // Single input and output

// Step 2: Compile the model
model.compile({
  optimizer: tf.train.sgd(0.1), // Stochastic Gradient Descent with a learning rate of 0.1
  loss: 'meanSquaredError',    // Loss function
});

// Step 3: Prepare the training data
const xs = tf.tensor1d([1, 2, 3, 4]); // Features
const ys = tf.tensor1d([1, 3, 5, 7]); // Labels (y = 2x - 1)

// Step 4: Train the model
(async () => {
  await model.fit(xs, ys, {
    epochs: 100, // Number of training iterations
    verbose: 0,  // Suppress training logs
  });
  
  // Step 5: Make predictions
  const prediction = model.predict(tf.tensor1d([5]));
  prediction.print(); // Outputs: [9], since y = 2(5) - 1
})();
```

Explanation of the Code
Model Definition: A sequential model is used, with a single dense layer representing 
𝑦=𝑤𝑥+𝑏
y=wx+b.
Compilation: The model is compiled with the sgd optimizer and meanSquaredError loss function.
Training Data: xs represents the input data, and ys represents the corresponding outputs.
Training the Model: The model is trained over 100 epochs to minimize the loss function.
Prediction: After training, the model predicts the value of 𝑦 y for a given 𝑥  x.


### Visualizing the Results

Visual tools such as tfvis can help monitor the training process and validate the model's accuracy. For more complex datasets or models, visualization becomes increasingly important

```js
import * as tfvis from '@tensorflow/tfjs-vis';

// Monitor training
const history = await model.fit(xs, ys, {
  epochs: 100,
  callbacks: tfvis.show.fitCallbacks(
    { name: 'Training Performance' },
    ['loss'],
    { height: 200, callbacks: ['onEpochEnd'] }
  ),
});

```
