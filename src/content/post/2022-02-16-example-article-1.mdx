## What is a Tensor in TensorFlow.js?

In TensorFlow.js, a **tensor** is the fundamental building block for data representation. A tensor is a multidimensional array that can hold values such as numbers, booleans, or even more complex types. These values are arranged in an N-dimensional space (1D, 2D, 3D, or more), making tensors highly flexible for representing various types of data in machine learning, such as:

- Scalar values (single numbers)
- Vectors (1D arrays)
- Matrices (2D arrays)
- High-dimensional arrays (3D and beyond)

For example, a 3D tensor might represent the pixel values of a color image, where the dimensions correspond to height, width, and the color channels (red, green, blue).

```ts title="example.ts" caption="Creating a 2D Tensor in TensorFlow.js"
import * as tf from '@tensorflow/tfjs';

// Create a 2D tensor (matrix) with shape [2, 3]
const tensor = tf.tensor([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]);
console.log(tensor.toString());

```
